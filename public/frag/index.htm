          Here is an imaginary store I made up right now. It's probably not a very great story. You may not even read 
          it this far because it really lacks substance. Heck, there's not even a plot. I mean, you'd think the first thing I'd do 
          when writing a story is think up a decent plot. But no. Not this story. We haven't even a single character to follow. If 
          you're still reading, I'm amazed. This is probably the biggest waste of time you've engaged in all day. (Now just think about 
          how much time I'm wasting writing it.) But, some things you just gotta do, ya know?
